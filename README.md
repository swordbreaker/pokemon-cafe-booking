# Pokémon Cafe Reservation System

Original is form https://github.com/cloudsystemsarchitect/pokemon-cafe-booking
I altered the code to work with Windows and Edge. And to work with the updated Website (07.02.2024).

This notebook is a simple script for automating the booking process at the Pokémon Cafe in Tokyo, Japan. It is written in a Juypiter notebook, so just open the pokemon-cafe-reservation.ipynb and follow the steps. This notebook uses the Python library Selenium to automate the reservation process. 

Have Fun!
